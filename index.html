                    <h2>About the Opera House</h2>
                    <p>The Sydney Opera House is a multipurpose performing arts facility located on Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), 
                        New South Wales, Australia. It is one of the most iconic and photographed buildings in the world due to its 
                        gleaming white sail-shaped shell roof structure. The building comprises multiple performance venues. The largest
                        venue, the 2,679-seat Concert Hall, hosts many symphony concerts, choir performances, and music shows. The internationally 
                        acclaimed Sydney Symphony Orchestra performs more than 180 concerts a year with some of the world's most illustrious
                        conductors and soloists. Whenever they perform at the Opera House, the temperature must be maintained at 72.5&#176;F(22.5&#176;C)
                        in order to keep the musicians' instruments in tune. The heating and air-conditioning system is powered by cold seawater pulled 
                        directly from Sydney Harbour.

                        Construction for the Opera House began in 1959 after Danish architect JÃ¸rn Utzon summitted his design for an
                        international design competition in 1957. The opening of the Opera House was originally planned for Australian 
                        Day (January 26) in 1963, but cost overruns and structure engineering difficulties in executing the design troubled
                        the course of the work, which forced many delays. After 14 years, it was finally completed on 20 October 1973 and formally
                        opened by Queen Elizabeth II. The original cost was estimated at $7 million. The final cost was $102 million and it was
                        largely paid by a State lottery. More than 10.9 million people visit the Opera House every year. Each year, Lunar
                        New Year is celebrated at the Opera House with the sails lit in red, Lunar Lanterns and Mandarin tours. In 2019, some
                        250,000 people celebrated this.
